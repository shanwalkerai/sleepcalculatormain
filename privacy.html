      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> April 7, 2025</p>

      <p>This Privacy Policy describes how AI Sleep Calculator ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your information when you use our website (the "Service").</p> <!-- Updated Text -->

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>We collect minimal information necessary to provide and improve our Service:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We may automatically collect information about how the Service is accessed and used. This Usage Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, browser version, the pages of our Service that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data. This data is typically anonymized or aggregated.</li>
        <li><strong>Calculator Inputs:</strong> The times, durations, ages, and questionnaire answers you enter into the calculators and AI analysis tools are processed locally in your browser or on our server solely to perform the calculation, generate reports/scores, and display the results. We do not store this specific input data linked to your identity after the calculation is performed unless explicitly stated (e.g., for future AI features requiring user accounts, which would require separate consent).</li> <!-- Updated Text -->
        <li><strong>Cookies and Tracking Technologies:</strong> We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons) to track activity on our Service and hold certain information. Cookies are files with a small amount of data which may include an anonymous unique identifier. You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of our Service. We may use:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Session Cookies:</strong> To operate our Service.</li>
                <li><strong>Preference Cookies:</strong> To remember your preferences (like theme choice).</li>
                <li><strong>Analytics Cookies:</strong> Third-party cookies (e.g., Google Analytics) may be used to help us understand how our Service is used. These providers have their own privacy policies.</li>
                <li><strong>Advertising Cookies:</strong> Third-party cookies (e.g., Google AdSense) may be used to serve ads relevant to you.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
         <li><strong>Contact Information:</strong> If you contact us directly via email, we will collect your name, email address, and any information you choose to provide in your message.</li>
         <li><strong>Authentication Information:</strong> If you create an account (e.g., for admin access), we collect your email address and hashed password via Supabase Authentication.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>We use the collected information for various purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To provide and maintain our Service (including performing calculations, generating AI reports/scores, and authentication).</li> <!-- Updated Text -->
        <li>To improve, personalize, and expand our Service.</li>
        <li>To understand and analyze how you use our Service.</li>
        <li>To communicate with you, either directly or through one of our partners, including for customer service, to provide you with updates and other information relating to the Service, and for marketing and promotional purposes (where permitted).</li>
        <li>To show advertisements (potentially personalized) through third-party services like Google AdSense.</li>
        <li>To detect, prevent, and address technical issues.</li>
        <li>To comply with legal obligations.</li>
      </ul>

       <h2>Advertising (Google AdSense)</h2>
        <p>We use Google AdSense to display advertisements on our website. Google uses cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to our website or other websites. Google's use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads to our users based on their visit to our sites and/or other sites on the Internet.</p>
        <p>Users may opt out of personalized advertising by visiting <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Ad Settings</a>. Alternatively, you can opt out of a third-party vendor's use of cookies for personalized advertising by visiting <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.aboutads.info/choices</a>.</p>


      <h2>Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
      <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share information under the following circumstances:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>With Service Providers:</strong> We may employ third-party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service ("Service Providers"), provide the Service on our behalf, perform Service-related services, or assist us in analyzing how our Service is used (e.g., hosting via Supabase, analytics). These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</li>
        <li><strong>For Advertising:</strong> As mentioned, we share information with advertising partners like Google AdSense to display ads.</li>
        <li><strong>For Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or a government agency).</li>
        <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your information may be transferred.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data Security</h2>
      <p>The security of your data is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. We use Supabase for backend services, which provides robust security features, but we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

      <h2>Your Data Protection Rights</h2>
      <p>Depending on your location, you may have certain data protection rights, including the right to access, update, or delete the information we have on you, the right of rectification, the right to object, the right of restriction, the right to data portability, and the right to withdraw consent. Please contact us if you wish to exercise any of these rights.</p>

      <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with Personal Information, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Information from children without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information.</p>

      <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
      <p>Our Service may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>

      <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
